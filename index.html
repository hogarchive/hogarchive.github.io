        <p class="content">Welcome to The Hog Official Archive, the dedicated repository for all things related to the
            cherished cartoon character, The Hog! My mission is to honor the legacy of this lost show by meticulously
            archiving every bit of information I can find. Dive into a treasure trove of nostalgia as I piece together
            the fragments of The Hog's world, bringing the joy and laughter of this beloved character back to
            life.<br><br>

            The Hog, a big green man with a penchant for rolling like a bowling ball, captured my heart with his
            larger-than-life presence. Weighing in at a whopping 700 pounds, this Mexican-born character, sporting an
            army hat and glasses, brought countless smiles to my face. I miss The Hog and all the hilarious moments he
            shared with his sister, the Hogette. So, welcome to The Hog Official Archive! Join me as I embark on a
            personal journey of rediscovery, preserving the memory of The Hog and celebrating the joy he brought into
            our lives.<br><br>

            The Hog, as we all know, comes from the television show shown from 1920 named "The Hog". Since 1937, roughly
            around World War II, all footage of The Hog has weant missing and nobody has made an attempt to rediscover
            it. We hope you'll be able to join us in our effort to re-archive this beloved character's content.</p>
